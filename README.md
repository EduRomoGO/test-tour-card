# Test tour card

## Install

Run `npm i`  

Start dev server with `npm start`  

## Considerations

Things to do given enough time

- Proper component testing
- Use react-virtual or other approach to load the list (maybe pagination), which takes a while (also on sorting)
- Styles are pretty messy, some action should be taken to improve maintainability
- Move sort criteria icon code to external svg file
- Some components are sharing files, they should be moved to its own file
